				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>In the 1960s, computer operating software and compilers were delivered as a part of hardware purchases without separate fees. At the time, source code, the human-readable form of software, was generally distributed with the software providing the ability to fix bugs or add new functions. Universities were early adopters of computing technology. Many of the modifications developed by universities were openly shared, in keeping with the academic principles of sharing knowledge, and organizations sprung up to facilitate sharing.

				<h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
				<p>The question "Why open source?" really encompasses two questions for the enterprise to consider: "Why use open source software?" and "Why should I develop my software in a community-based, open source way?" Inherent in that second question is the issue of what enterprises can learn from the successes of open source communities.So, who should care about the answers to these questions? Well, virtually everyone.Open source applications are now available for every common type of enterprise software from databases to security software.<a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/69788.html">more</a></p>

				<h2>Benefits of OSS</h2>
				<p>Open Source's proponents often claim that it offers significant benefits when compared to typical commercial products. Commercial products typically favour visible features (giving marketing advantage) over harder-to measure qualities . We shall describe this phenomenon as quality vs features.Open Source Software developers are evidently motivated by many factors but favouring features over quality is not happening. For many developers, peer review and acclaim is important, so it's likely that they will prefer to build software that is admired by their peers.<a href="http://open-source.gbdirect.co.uk/migration/benefit.html">more</a></p>

				<h2>Loerem Ipsum</h2>
				<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</p>
